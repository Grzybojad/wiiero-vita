Wiiero is a clone of Liero specially developped for Wii.

Liero is a fight game between two worms armed with heavy weapons of all kinds
battling in underground caves. It was created by the Finnish programmer 
Joosa Riekkinen in 1998. The game is often described as a real-time version of
Worms, or a 2D version of Quake III. Its last release was version 1.33, 
released in 1999.

You play Wiiero exctly the same way as you played Liero: same game modes, same
original weapons, coming with new ones like vermifuge, holy grenade, or even 
plasma canon! Wiiero is a two player game, using the wiimote alone or both
wiimote and nunchuk on the Wii and keyboard on PC.

In wiiero game you can fight your opponent in 3 different game modes: 
 Deathmatch, Capture the flag and Game of tag.
    * The goal of the "deathmatch" mode is simply killing the enemy by hurting
       him the most possible. Lives are mimited and the player with no more
       lives will be the loser. You can define the number of lives for both
       players in the "option" menu.
    * The goal of the "game of tag" is to kill the enemy for him to become the
       "tag". When a player is the "tag", his time counter decreases. When your
       counter reaches 0, the game is over and you lost. However, you can kill
       your enemy before that time and he becomes the "tag", his counter will
       therefor begin decreasing. The time limit can be modified in the
       "option" menu.
    * Finally, in the "capture the flag" mode, you will need to get your
       opponents flag somewhere on the map and take it back to your home,
       giving you 1 point. However, to pick up your opponents flag, he must not
       be in possession of your own flag. Otherwise you will need to kill him!
       The first player accumulating the defined number of flags wins. 
       You can modify the limit of flags in the "option" menu.
